# SQL
SQL Practice

## The purpose of this lab is to practice SQL - an important skill in data science!

In this  notebook we have ten prompts. Each prompt will require you to do two things:

> Write a SQL query.
>
> Use the result of that query to answer the question.

## Data
The data used in this lab is the famous (but fake) Northwind database. It contains various tables of transactions. The schema for the Northwind database can be found here
